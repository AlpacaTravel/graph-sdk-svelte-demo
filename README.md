# Svelte Demo using @alpaca-travel/graph-sdk

Svelte offers an excellent environment for developing lightweight vanilla JavaScript applications.

This demo shows that you can build a working site, loading a list of places you have selected from an Alpaca Collection, and can allow users to manage an itinerary, all without heavy project libraries.

The total demo size is ~10KB for all dependencies. Network requests leverage GraphQL to only fetch the data needed.

## Running local

Clone this demo down, and you can then run the following command:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once started, visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser to interact with an example site.
