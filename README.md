# Svelte Demo using @alpaca-travel/graph-sdk

Svelte offers an excellent environment for developing lightweight vanilla JavaScript applications.

This demo shows that you can build a working site:

- Load a list of curated places you've added to an Alpaca collection :earth_africa: :earth_americas: :earth_asia:
- Add/Remove/View items from an itinerary :hammer: :wrench: :rocket:
- Network calls using GraphQL to only fetch the data needed :envelope: :speedboat:
- Lightweight ~10KB total for app and dependencies :school_satchel:

## Running local

Clone this demo down, and you can then run the following command:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once started, visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser to interact with an example site.
