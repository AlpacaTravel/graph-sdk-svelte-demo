# Svelte Demo using @alpaca-travel/graph-sdk

Svelte offers an excellent environment for developing lightweight vanilla JavaScript applications.

This demo shows that you can build a working site:

- Load a list of places from a collection you have made
- Add/Remove items from an itinerary
- View your itinerary

The total demo size is ~10KB for all dependencies, demonstrating that these functions can be lightweight. Network requests leverage GraphQL to only fetch the data needed.

## Running local

Clone this demo down, and you can then run the following command:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once started, visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser to interact with an example site.
